# 🚀 ALOGAM Engine 2.0 
**A Legacy Reimagined**
---
## Overview
ALOGAM Engine 2.0 is the successor to the original ALOGAM engine. Built from the ground up, this new engine is a complete reimagining of the original, addressing its limitations and enhancing its capabilities. With a focus on performance, clarity, and modernity, ALOGAM 2.0 aims to provide developers with a powerful and flexible platform for creating high-quality games.
No more dependencies or legacy constraints. ALOGAM 2.0 is designed to be a standalone, lightweight engine that is easy to use and integrate into your project.

## Features
### Modern Graphics Pipeline
Built exclusively on Vulkan for high-performance rendering across multiple platforms.
### Lightweight Window Management
Powered by GLFW for robust window handling and input management.
### Advanced Audio
Integrated OpenAL-SOFT for spatial audio and high-fidelity sound processing.
### Dependency-Lite
Stripped of unnecessary dependencies. The core engine only relies on Vulkan, GLFW, and OpenAL-SOFT, ensuring a lean and efficient codebase.
### Open & Free
This engine is open-source and free, making it accessible to developers around the world.

## Architecture Goals
The goal of ALOGAM 2.0's architecture is to provide a flexible and scalable platform that can be adapted to a wide range of game development needs. By focusing on performance, simplicity, and extensibility, we aim to create a tool that empowers developers to bring their ideas to life.
1. **Modularity:** Separate systems for graphics, audio, and physics to ensure clean and maintainable code.
2. **Performance:** Optimization through low-overhead Vulkan design for maximum throughput and efficiency.
3. **Simplicity:** Clear and readable codebase that is easy to maintain and understand, free from the "legacy engine" baggage.
4. **Portability:** Targeted for Windows, Linux, and potentially other supported platforms using our core libraries.
**ALOGAM Engine 2.0** is currently in active development, with the core rendering and windowing components being established. This is not simply an update, but a revolution under the hood.
